This is a simple NUI payment system to allow transactions to and from employees and customers.

The thought process behind it was Roleplay, instead of going, oh whats your ID amd ima charge you 20$, 
it's more like your order number is #1001 go ahead and swipe the card and pay for it.

free is free, want any more features? Add them yourself? Don't know how? unlucky.t/
